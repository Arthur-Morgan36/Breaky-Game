# Breaky Eggy

## ☍ Game Overview
The player is immersed into a 2D dimension.

The player suddenly finds himself in front of an enemy castle. All of his egg friends are trapped behind bars.
The player is armed with a cannon that shoots one ball at a time. He can move the platform he's on or rotate the cannon to control the direction of the shot. The player wants to destroy all of the bricks that make the enemy's castle. Once destroyed, he can free his egg friends. However, as he attacks the castle, the enemy attacks back with yellow projectiles that are shot from random places. Nowhere is safe, it's either him or his friends.
